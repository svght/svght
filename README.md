This stroy star in 2021 summer at my office in GZ.China.
one day,I was try to finish my online-learning assigments and get enough Credits.
This was bound to take up 120 hours of my work time，it equal to 15 work days. I really tired of doing this.
Considering that I still have to work in the civil service for more than 20 years before retiring.
I decided to fix this issue indeed.
In the beginning, I was going to look for ready-made software on the Internet, 
and it turned out that there were only a bunch of paid fakes, and almost every "fake" came with a Trojan.
But such a search lasted an hour, and I did not reach my goal. But it wasn't for nothing, 
I came across GitHub and realized that programming seemed like something I could teach myself.
So why didn't I write one by myself!!!
Since I had never been exposed to professional training in programming, and know nothing about how computer works.
I had to learn the basics，I have to say: I took a lot of detours in the process of learning.
I found programming...very interesting.
It Can become a lifelong hobby :-)
Finally, in November 2022, the first usable automatic version for GZ civil service Online training system  was written.


The world belongs to lazy people who can keep working hard for their goals--Make life more beautiful.
